    "contents": "\r\nBackground\r\nPredicting the survival of newborns is crucial in clinical decision making especially prior to deliveries. For instance, the probability of survival of a child born at any gestational age, weight, and a specific locality should be readily known to make clinical judgments and for counselling prospective mothers.\r\nObjective\r\nThis post analyses and outlines the probability of survival for newborns admitted to a tertiary hospital in Ghana.\r\nData\r\nData for all newborns admitted to the hospital’s Mother and Baby Unit was recorded from 2013 to 2015. The probability of survival with the 95% confidence interval are as displayed below for males and female separately.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSurvival by birth weight\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is also illustrated graphically below\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSurvival by gestational age\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is also illustrated graphically below\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
